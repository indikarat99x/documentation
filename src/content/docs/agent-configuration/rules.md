title: Rules Configuration
description: How rules.json controls what the agent does when a webhook arrives.
---

`rules.json` is the single configuration surface that controls **what the agent does** when a webhook arrives. Each entry in the JSON array is a self-contained rule set that maps a webhook name to one or more **execution blocks**. Each block independently declares payload filters, input extraction, plugin installation, and a Claude Code prompt template — so a single inbound event can fan out into multiple specialised workflows without any custom code.

If **multiple** execution blocks in the same rule set match one webhook payload, **each** match is scheduled as its own run (separate activation / executor session) with that block's inputs, plugins, and prompt.

```
rules.json  →  WebhookRulesEvaluator  →  EventOrchestrator  →  ProcessingWorkflow  →  Executor Container
```

In the **the-agent** reference implementation, the default file is `Knowledge/rules.json`, embedded at agent registration as Xians knowledge document **`Rules`**.

---

## File Structure

`rules.json` is a JSON array of **rule set** objects. Each rule set targets one **webhook** name (case-insensitive) and contains an **executions** array. Each execution is an independent pipeline: optional filters, inputs, plugins, and prompt.

```jsonc
[
  {
    "webhook": "...",
    "executions": [
      {
        "name": "...",
        "platform": "...",
        "repository": {
          "url": "...",
          "ref": "..."
        },
        "match-any":  [ ... ],
        "use-inputs": [ ... ],
        "use-plugins":[ ... ],
        "with-envs":  [ ... ],
        "execute-prompt": "..."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `webhook` | Webhook name from Xians Agent Studio (must match incoming events) |
| `executions` | One or more execution blocks; optional per-block `name` for logs and skip messages |
| `platform` *(per execution, optional)* | Hosting service the run targets (`github`, `azuredevops`, …). Structural — describes *where* the run happens, independent of the plugin. See [§ 1b](#1b-platform--repository--structural-execution-context). |
| `repository` *(per execution, optional)* | Structural binding for the repository being operated on. Each declared sub-field (`url`, `ref`) accepts either a JSON path (resolved against the payload) or a constant via `{ "value": "...", "constant": true }`. Auto-resolved values are exposed to plugins as `{{repository-url}}` / `{{repository-name}}` / `{{git-ref}}`; **`{{repository-name}}` is derived from `url`, never authored**. Omit the whole block for executions that don't operate on a repo. See [§ 1b](#1b-platform--repository--structural-execution-context). |
| `with-envs` *(per execution, optional)* | Container env vars injected before the prompt runs. Each entry **must** declare its source explicitly: `secrets.KEY` (tenant Secret Vault), `host.NAME` (agent process env), or a literal with `"constant": true`. Bare names and unknown prefixes fail the activation. See [§ 5](#5-with-envs--container-environment-variables). |

Each execution block that passes its `match-any` filters is scheduled independently when multiple blocks match the same payload.

## 1. `webhook`

Case-insensitive match against the webhook name configured in Xians Agent Studio.

```json
"webhook": "Default"
```

Only one rule set per webhook name is used — the **first** matching entry in the `rules.json` array wins.

---

## 1b. `platform` & `repository` — Structural Execution Context

These two execution-level fields describe **what the run operates on** — independent of which plugin is used. They sit alongside `match-any` / `use-inputs` / `use-plugins` and are resolved before any plugin runs. The framework uses them directly (credential setup, workspace volume, worktree checkout, chat-side input resolution) **and** auto-injects the resolved values into `XIANIX_INPUTS` under canonical kebab-case keys, so plugin prompts and the executor entrypoint can read them off the same keys they always have.

```json
"platform": "github",
"repository": {
  "url": "repository.clone_url",
  "ref": "pull_request.head.ref"
}
```

| Field             | Type                                                               | Description |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `platform`        | string literal                                                     | Hosting service (`github`, `azuredevops`, …). Used by the executor to pick the right `git` credential helper and is exposed to plugin prompts as `{{platform}}`. Empty / omitted means the executor will infer from the repo URL (defaults to `github`). |
| `repository.url`  | string (JSON path) **or** `{ value, constant }` object             | Either a JSON path that resolves to the clone URL (the common webhook-driven case) or a hard-coded literal via the constant form (see [Hard-coding the repository](#hard-coding-the-repository-constant-form)). **Mandatory when declared** — if a declared JSON path doesn't resolve, the execution block is skipped before any container starts. Exposed as `{{repository-url}}`. |
| `repository.ref`  | string (JSON path) **or** `{ value, constant }` object             | Either a JSON path that resolves to the git ref (branch, commit SHA, or tag), or a constant pinning the run to a fixed branch/tag. **Mandatory when declared.** Omit entirely to run against the bare-clone HEAD. Exposed as `{{git-ref}}` and used directly by `Executor/entrypoint.sh` to position the worktree before the prompt runs. |

> **`{{repository-name}}` is derived, not declared.** A short `owner/repo`-style identifier is computed from the resolved `repository.url` (platform-aware: GitHub, Azure DevOps `_git` URLs, etc.) and auto-injected as `{{repository-name}}`. There is no `repository.name` knob in the schema — clone URL and display name are kept in lockstep so they can never drift. If you need a different display name, pick a different clone URL.

#### Hard-coding the repository (constant form)

For runs whose repository or ref is fixed regardless of the webhook payload — cron pings, Slack triggers, single-tenant agents pinned to one repo, manual triggers — wrap the value in `{ "value": "...", "constant": true }`:

```json
"repository": {
  "url": { "value": "https://github.com/my-org/agent-target.git", "constant": true },
  "ref": { "value": "main",                                          "constant": true }
}
```

The bare-string shorthand (`"url": "repository.clone_url"`) is just sugar for `{ "value": "repository.clone_url", "constant": false }`, so existing rules need no changes. Mixed forms also fall out naturally — clone a fixed mirror but check out whatever ref the webhook says:

```json
"repository": {
  "url": { "value": "https://github.com/my-org/mirror.git", "constant": true },
  "ref": "pull_request.head.ref"
}
```

Constant URLs of course also drive `{{repository-name}}` — the derivation runs on the resolved URL regardless of how it was supplied.

### Why are these separate from `use-inputs`?

- They are **structural** — every webhook-triggered run on a repo needs them, regardless of plugin. Promoting them to execution-level removes per-plugin duplication and makes the contract explicit.
- The framework needs them **before** the plugin loop runs (clone target, credential helper, volume name, worktree ref) — they were already special-cased; now the schema reflects that.
- `repository.ref` is part of the *binding* (which repo, at which ref), not a free-form input the prompt happens to use — nesting it next to `url` keeps that relationship obvious.
- The chat-driven path (`SupervisorSubagentTools.RunClaudeCodeOnRepository`) treats `RepositoryUrl` / `RepositoryName` as first-class typed fields and derives the display name from the URL the same way the webhook path does. Aligning the webhook schema removes a subtle divergence.
- Executions that don't operate on a repo (e.g. Azure DevOps work-item analysis) just **omit** the `repository` block — no need for `mandatory: false` ceremony on per-plugin inputs.

### Wire-format

Plugin prompts and `Executor/entrypoint.sh` always read structural values from these canonical `XIANIX_INPUTS` keys (`platform`, `repository-url`, `repository-name`, `git-ref`). The agent serialises the resolved structural values into the inputs dict under exactly these keys — they are **not** authored under `use-inputs` and the same key names are not used for anything else. `repository-name` is the derived value (from `repository.url`), not a separate path.

### Mandatory semantics

The structural fields use the **same skip-on-missing behaviour** as a `use-inputs` entry with `"mandatory": true`:

- If a declared sub-field uses the **JSON-path** form (`"url": "repository.clone_url"`) and the path doesn't resolve, the block is skipped with a clear error and no executor container starts.
- The **constant** form (`{ "value": "...", "constant": true }`) skips the resolution check entirely — the literal is taken verbatim, so a constant binding can't fail mid-flight. An empty constant value (`{ "value": "", "constant": true }`) is treated as "field undeclared" rather than "field set to empty" — that's an authoring mistake the framework refuses to silently propagate.
- Other execution blocks in the same rule set are still evaluated — the failure is per-block.
- `platform` is a literal so it always "resolves" — there's nothing to fail.
- `repository-name` is derived from `repository.url` and never fails on its own — if the URL is unparseable the raw URL flows through as the display name so logs stay useful.

---

## 2. `match-any` — Payload Filtering

Inside each execution block, `match-any` is an array of filter rules evaluated with **OR logic**: the block passes if **any** entry matches. If `match-any` is omitted or empty, the block passes unconditionally.

```json
"match-any": [
  { "name": "pr-opened-event",       "rule": "action==opened" },
  { "name": "pr-synchronize-event",  "rule": "action==synchronize" }
]
```

| Field  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `name` | Human-readable label (for logging and skip reasons) |
| `rule` | A filter expression — see syntax below |

### Filter Expression Syntax

Each rule is a comparison of a **JSON path** against a **literal value**, optionally combined with `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) operators:

```
<json-path> <operator> <expected-value>
```

Six operators are supported. All string comparisons are case-sensitive and ordinal.

| Operator | Meaning                                         | Missing path returns |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `==`     | Equals                                          | `false`              |
| `!=`     | Not equals                                      | `true`               |
| `^=`     | Starts with (string prefix match)               | `false`              |
| `!^=`    | Does not start with                             | `true`               |
| `*=`     | Contains (substring match)                      | `false`              |
| `!*=`    | Does not contain                                | `true`               |

`^=`, `!^=`, `*=`, and `!*=` only match **string** values — they never match numbers, booleans, or `null`.

Two additional **unary** operators check whether a path exists (resolves to a non-null value) without comparing against a right-hand side:

| Operator | Meaning                                              | Missing path returns |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `?`      | Exists — path resolves and value is not `null`       | `false`              |
| `!?`     | Not exists — path is missing or value is `null`      | `true`               |

Unary operators are appended directly to the path with no value on the right:

```jsonc
// Passes when the payload has a non-null "pull_request.title"
"rule": "pull_request.title?"

// Passes when the payload does NOT have a "pull_request.draft" field (or it is null)
"rule": "pull_request.draft!?"
```

### Compound Expressions

Multiple conditions can be combined in a single rule using `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR):

| Operator | Meaning | Precedence |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `&&`     | AND — all conditions in the group must be true | Higher |
| `||`     | OR — at least one group must be true           | Lower  |

`||` has lower precedence than `&&`. The rule is split into OR-groups first, then each group is split into AND-conditions.

```jsonc
// Both conditions must be true
"rule": "eventType==workitem.updated&&status==Active"

// Either condition can be true
"rule": "action==opened||action==reopened"

// Mixed: (A AND B) OR (C AND D)
"rule": "eventType==created&&status==New||eventType==updated&&status==Active"
```

### Quoted Values

If the expected value contains `&&` or `||` (or you want a single-quoted literal), wrap it in **single quotes**:

```jsonc
"rule": "assignee=='some-user <user@example.com>'"
```

Quotes are optional for simple values. Both of these are equivalent:

```jsonc
"rule": "action==opened"
"rule": "action=='opened'"
```

### JSON Paths

JSON paths use dot notation to traverse the payload. Given:

```json
{ "action": "opened", "pull_request": { "draft": false } }
```

| Expression                  | Result  |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| `action==opened`            | `true`  |
| `action!=closed`            | `true`  |
| `pull_request.draft==false` | `true`  |
| `action==closed`            | `false` |

Type coercion is handled automatically — strings, numbers, booleans, and `null` are compared against the literal on the right-hand side.

#### Property names that contain `.`

If an object **key** contains a dot (common on Azure DevOps, e.g. `System.AssignedTo`), a plain dot-separated path would be ambiguous. Wrap **that segment** in **double quotes** so it is treated as a single property name:

```
resource.fields."System.AssignedTo".newValue
resource.revision.fields."System.Title"
```

Inside a double-quoted segment, a **backslash** escapes the next character (for example if the key itself needed a quote).

This applies to **match** rules and to **`use-inputs`** paths (see below).

#### Arrays: numeric indices

When the value at a path segment is a JSON **array**, a **numeric** segment selects the element at that index (zero-based):

```
items.0.id
resource.reviewers.1.displayName
```

If the index is out of range, the path does not resolve (`==` fails; `!=` treats a missing path as not equal).

#### Arrays: wildcard `*` (match rules only)

For **filter rules** (`match-any`), a path segment `*` means "any element of the array at this point." The prefix before `*` must resolve to an array. The suffix is evaluated against each element until one matches (for positive operators) or none match (for negative operators).

```
resource.reviewers.*.displayName=='xianix-agent'
```

This passes if **any** reviewer object has `displayName` equal to `xianix-agent`. The wildcard works with all operators:

```
// passes if any label name starts with "hotfix/"
labels.*.name^='hotfix/'

// passes if any message in the thread contains a keyword
comments.*.body*='needs review'

// passes if any reviewer has a non-null "email" field
resource.reviewers.*.email?
```

Only **one** `*` segment per path is supported.

Wildcard `*` is **not** supported in **`use-inputs`** paths — use a fixed numeric index there if you need a specific array element.

### Operator Examples

**Starts with (`^=` / `!^=`)**

Match a branch that follows a naming convention, or filter events from a specific bot:

```jsonc
// Trigger only for feature branches
"rule": "pull_request.head.ref^=feature/"

// Skip anything pushed by a bot account
"rule": "sender.login!^=bot-"

// Azure DevOps: source branch is a release branch
"rule": "resource.sourceRefName^=refs/heads/release/"
```

**Contains (`*=` / `!*=`)**

Match free-form text fields like commit messages, PR titles, or notification messages:

```jsonc
// Trigger when a PR title signals a breaking change
"rule": "pull_request.title*=BREAKING"

// Azure DevOps: react to specific activity messages
"rule": "message.text*='updated the source branch'"
"rule": "message.text*='as a reviewer'"

// Skip draft descriptions that mention WIP
"rule": "pull_request.body!*=[WIP]"
```

**Exists (`?` / `!?`)**

Check whether a field is present (and non-null) in the payload — useful for optional fields that aren't always sent:

```jsonc
// Only trigger when the payload carries a pull_request object
"rule": "action==opened&&pull_request?"

// Trigger when a reviewer has been assigned (field present)
"rule": "requested_reviewer.login?"

// Skip payloads that have no body text
"rule": "pull_request.body?"

// Only match when the milestone is NOT set
"rule": "pull_request.milestone!?"
```

---

## 3. `use-inputs` — Payload Extraction

Extracts values from the webhook payload into named variables. They are used for `execute-prompt` interpolation and are forwarded to the executor (for example as `XIANIX_INPUTS`).

> **Don't put structural context here.** `platform`, `repository-url`, `repository-name`, and `git-ref` are declared at the [execution level](#1b-platform--repository--structural-execution-context) and auto-injected into `XIANIX_INPUTS` for you. Authoring them under `use-inputs` is unsupported — the framework uses the structural fields for credential setup, volume management, worktree checkout, and chat-side input validation.

```json
"use-inputs": [
  { "name": "pr-number", "value": "number",             "mandatory": true },
  { "name": "pr-title",  "value": "pull_request.title" }
]
```

| Field       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `name`      | Key in the extracted dictionary |
| `value`     | Dot-separated JSON path into the payload, **or** a literal when `constant` is `true` |
| `constant`  | *(optional, default `false`)* When `true`, `value` is used as-is instead of resolving a path |
| `mandatory` | *(optional, default `false`)* When `true`, the execution block is **skipped** if this input resolves to `null`, an empty string, or a whitespace-only string |

When a mandatory input fails, the execution block is skipped with a clear error message listing which inputs were missing. Other execution blocks in the same rule set are still evaluated — a single missing mandatory input does not abort the entire webhook.

### Path Resolution Examples

Given:

```json
{
  "number": 42,
  "repository": { "clone_url": "https://github.com/acme/app.git", "full_name": "acme/app" },
  "pull_request": { "title": "Fix auth bug", "head": { "ref": "fix/auth" } }
}
```

| Input definition | Resolved value |
|------------------|----------------|
| `"value": "number"` | `42` |
| `"value": "pull_request.head.ref"` | `"fix/auth"` |
| `"value": "pull_request.title"` | `"Fix auth bug"` |
| `"value": "high", "constant": true` | `"high"` (literal) |
| `"value": "resource.revision.fields.\"System.Title\""` (path uses a quoted segment for a dotted key) | Azure DevOps work item `System.Title` |

> Need the clone URL, repo name, platform, or checked-out ref in your prompt? Reference `{{repository-url}}`, `{{repository-name}}`, `{{platform}}`, or `{{git-ref}}` directly — they're auto-injected from the [structural fields](#1b-platform--repository--structural-execution-context).

If a path does not resolve (missing property), the input is set to `null`. If the input is marked `"mandatory": true`, the entire execution block is skipped instead.

---

## 4. `use-plugins` — Plugin Installation

Declares Claude Code marketplace plugins to install in the executor container before the prompt runs.

```json
"use-plugins": [
  {
    "plugin-name": "pr-reviewer@xianix-plugins-official",
    "marketplace": "xianix-team/plugins-official"
  }
]
```

| Field           | Required | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `plugin-name`   | Yes | Plugin reference in `plugin-name@marketplace-name` form, passed to `claude plugin install` |
| `marketplace`   | No  | Marketplace source (`owner/repo`, git URL, path, or `marketplace.json` URL). Omit for the built-in Anthropic marketplace. |

> **Heads-up** — credentials a plugin needs (GitHub PAT, Azure DevOps PAT, third-party API keys) are **not** declared per-plugin. They live at the execution-block level in [`with-envs`](#5-with-envs--container-environment-variables) so a single value like `GITHUB-TOKEN` only has to be written once even when multiple plugins consume it.

---

## 5. `with-envs` — Container Environment Variables

Declares environment variables to inject into the executor container before the prompt runs. Sits at the **execution-block** level (sibling to `use-plugins`) — every variable is available to every plugin and to the prompt itself, regardless of how many plugins consume it.

```json
"with-envs": [
  { "name": "GITHUB-TOKEN",       "value": "secrets.GITHUB-TOKEN", "mandatory": true },
  { "name": "REVIEW_MODE",        "value": "strict",               "constant": true }
]
```

The executor container already has a small set of agent-managed variables present before any plugin runs. `with-envs` lets you **add** to that set — for tenant credentials, plugin configuration flags, or any value the prompt or its plugins need.

#### Variables automatically present in the container

The only variable seeded into every container from the agent host is:

| Variable              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`   | Anthropic API key (read directly by the Claude Code SDK). Set via `ANTHROPIC-API-KEY` in the agent's `.env` — same value for every tenant. |

CM platform tokens (`GITHUB-TOKEN`, `AZURE-DEVOPS-TOKEN`, …) are **not** read from the agent host. Each tenant must store their own in the **Xians Secret Vault** and declare them in `rules.json` via `with-envs`:

```json
"with-envs": [
  { "name": "GITHUB-TOKEN",       "value": "secrets.GITHUB-TOKEN",       "mandatory": true },
  { "name": "AZURE-DEVOPS-TOKEN", "value": "secrets.AZURE-DEVOPS-TOKEN", "mandatory": true }
]
```

This guarantees that two tenants never share the same platform credential — a tenant whose vault is missing the secret fails fast (when paired with `mandatory: true`) instead of silently borrowing a host-wide token.

#### Renaming a value for a plugin

Some Claude Code plugins expect a specific variable name that differs from the credential's canonical name. Use `with-envs` to expose the value under the name the plugin requires — the lookup form (`secrets.*`, `host.*`, or constant) determines where the value comes from, while `name` controls how the container sees it:

```json
{ "name": "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN", "value": "secrets.GITHUB-TOKEN" }
```

This fetches `GITHUB-TOKEN` from the tenant Secret Vault and makes it available as `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` inside the container — so the plugin can find it without any changes to how the credential is stored.

#### Three value forms at a glance

The `value` field supports three resolution forms — every entry **must** pick one explicitly. Bare names and unrecognised prefixes (including the legacy `env.X`) fail the activation with a non-retryable error so a typo can never silently leak a host env var into the container:

| Form                  | Resolved from                                              | When to use |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `host.VAR_NAME`       | Agent process environment (`.env` file / host env vars)    | Genuinely host-wide settings that are the same for every tenant (e.g. `ANTHROPIC-API-KEY`, deployment knobs) |
| `secrets.SECRET-KEY`  | **Tenant-scoped Xians Secret Vault** (encrypted at rest)   | Per-tenant credentials — GitHub PAT, Azure DevOps PAT, third-party API keys. The recommended (and only) place for credentials that differ per tenant. |
| Literal + `"constant": true` | The string is used verbatim                         | Plugin flags, region identifiers, public URLs, anything that isn't a credential |

#### `host.` reference syntax

Prefix the value with `host.` to read a variable from the **agent host** (the agent process environment, populated from the agent's `.env` file or whatever the deployment exports). The `host.` prefix is stripped and the remainder is the variable name to look up:

```json
{ "name": "MY_PLUGIN_TOKEN",    "value": "host.GITHUB_TOKEN" }
{ "name": "AZURE_PAT",          "value": "host.AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN" }
{ "name": "CUSTOM_SERVICE_KEY", "value": "host.MY_CUSTOM_API_KEY" }
```

If the referenced variable is not set on the host, the injected value will be an empty string. Combine with `"mandatory": true` to fail-fast instead.

> **Use `host.*` sparingly.** Anything tenant-specific belongs in the Secret Vault (`secrets.*`) — `host.*` is for values that are genuinely the same for every tenant on the agent.

#### `secrets.` reference syntax

Prefix the value with `secrets.` to fetch the credential from the **tenant-scoped Xians Secret Vault** at container-start time. The `secrets.` prefix is stripped and the remainder is treated as the secret **key** to look up in the active tenant's vault:

```json
{ "name": "GITHUB-TOKEN",          "value": "secrets.GITHUB-TOKEN",          "mandatory": true }
{ "name": "OPENAI_API_KEY",        "value": "secrets.openai-api-key",        "mandatory": true }
{ "name": "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET", "value": "secrets.stripe-webhook-secret" }
```

Under the hood, the agent runs the equivalent of:

```csharp
var vault   = XiansContext.CurrentAgent.Secrets.TenantScope();
var fetched = await vault.FetchByKeyAsync("GITHUB-TOKEN");
// fetched.Value is injected as the named env var inside the container.
```

Resolution rules:

- **Tenant scope is automatic.** The lookup is bound to the tenant that owns the inbound webhook — different tenants can store different values under the same key without colliding.
- **Encrypted at rest.** Values are stored AES-256-GCM-encrypted server-side; the agent only ever sees the decrypted plaintext in memory while building the container env.
- **No host-level fallback for platform credentials.** The agent host's `.env` no longer provides `GITHUB-TOKEN` / `AZURE-DEVOPS-TOKEN` — these *must* live in each tenant's vault, so a misconfigured tenant can never silently borrow another tenant's PAT.
- **Missing or empty secret** → the value resolves to an empty string. Combine with `"mandatory": true` (see below) to fail-fast instead of starting the container with a blank credential.
- **Vault errors are non-fatal** unless the entry is also `mandatory` — they are logged and the resolved value is empty.
- **Rotation is hot.** Updating a secret in the vault takes effect on the **next** container start; no agent restart or redeploy is required.

Manage the underlying secrets through the Xians Secret Vault (Agent API at `api/agent/secrets`, or any UI/CLI built on top of it) — supports create, list, update, and delete with strict per-tenant scope enforcement.

#### Constant values

Set `"constant": true` to inject a fixed literal string rather than resolving a host variable or a vault secret. This is useful for plugin configuration flags, region identifiers, or any value that does not come from the environment:

```json
{ "name": "REVIEW_MODE",    "value": "strict",    "constant": true }
{ "name": "TARGET_BRANCH",  "value": "main",      "constant": true }
{ "name": "AZURE_ORG_URL",  "value": "https://dev.azure.com/my-org", "constant": true }
```

#### Mandatory entries

Set `"mandatory": true` to make the executor container **fail to start** (non-retryably) when the resolved value is `null` or empty. This is the recommended pattern for any secret the prompt cannot run without:

```json
{ "name": "GITHUB-TOKEN", "value": "secrets.GITHUB-TOKEN", "mandatory": true }
```

The error message lists which env vars were missing and where to set them — the tenant Secret Vault for `secrets.*` entries, or the agent host `.env` for `host.*` entries.

#### Field reference

| Field       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `name`      | Name of the environment variable as it will appear inside the container |
| `value`     | Must use one of three explicit forms: `host.VAR_NAME` (read from the agent host environment), `secrets.SECRET-KEY` (read from the tenant Secret Vault), or a literal string when `constant` is `true`. Bare names and unrecognised prefixes (including the legacy `env.X`) fail the activation with a non-retryable error. |
| `constant`  | *(optional, default `false`)* When `true`, `value` is used as-is without any host or vault lookup |
| `mandatory` | *(optional, default `false`)* When `true`, the executor container fails to start (non-retryable) if the resolved value is `null` or empty |

## 6. `execute-prompt` — Claude Code Prompt Template

A string template run as the Claude Code prompt after plugins are installed. Use `{{input-name}}` placeholders for resolved `use-inputs` values.

```json
"execute-prompt": "You are reviewing PR #{{pr-number}} titled \"{{pr-title}}\" in {{repository-name}} (branch: {{git-ref}}).\n\nRun /code-review to perform the automated review."
```

Placeholders are replaced case-insensitively. Any `{{name}}` with no matching input is left unchanged.

---

## Complete Example

A rule set with one execution that reviews newly opened GitHub pull requests:

```json
[
  {
    "webhook": "Default",
    "executions": [
      {
        "name": "github-pull-request-review",
        "platform": "github",
        "repository": {
          "url": "repository.clone_url",
          "ref": "pull_request.head.ref"
        },
        "match-any": [
          { "name": "pr-opened-event", "rule": "action==opened" }
        ],
        "use-inputs": [
          { "name": "pr-number", "value": "number",             "mandatory": true },
          { "name": "pr-title",  "value": "pull_request.title" }
        ],
        "use-plugins": [
          {
            "plugin-name": "pr-reviewer@xianix-plugins-official",
            "marketplace": "xianix-team/plugins-official"
          }
        ],
        "with-envs": [
          { "name": "GITHUB-TOKEN", "value": "secrets.GITHUB-TOKEN", "mandatory": true }
        ],
        "execute-prompt": "You are reviewing pull request #{{pr-number}} titled \"{{pr-title}}\" in the repository {{repository-name}} (branch: {{git-ref}}).\n\nRun /code-review to perform the automated review. The `gh` CLI is authenticated and available if you need it directly."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Work-item example (no repository)

Executions that don't operate on a repo simply omit the `repository` block. `platform` can still be set to drive credential resolution:

```json
[
  {
    "webhook": "Default",
    "executions": [
      {
        "name": "azuredevops-workitem-triage",
        "platform": "azuredevops",
        "match-any": [
          { "name": "workitem-created", "rule": "eventType==workitem.created" }
        ],
        "use-inputs": [
          { "name": "workitem-id",    "value": "resource.id",                                  "mandatory": true },
          { "name": "workitem-title", "value": "resource.fields.\"System.Title\"" }
        ],
        "use-plugins": [
          {
            "plugin-name": "workitem-triage@xianix-plugins-official",
            "marketplace": "xianix-team/plugins-official"
          }
        ],
        "with-envs": [
          { "name": "AZURE-DEVOPS-TOKEN", "value": "secrets.AZURE-DEVOPS-TOKEN", "mandatory": true }
        ],
        "execute-prompt": "Triage Azure DevOps work item #{{workitem-id}}: \"{{workitem-title}}\". Run /workitem-triage to suggest area path, iteration, and labels."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Azure DevOps example: work item field with a dotted name

Filter when a field whose key contains dots changes (quoted segment):

```jsonc
"rule": "eventType==workitem.updated&&resource.fields.\"System.AssignedTo\".newValue=='xianix-agent <xianix-agent@99x.io>'"
```

### Azure DevOps example: PR updated with a specific reviewer

Require both the event type and the agent in the reviewers list:

```jsonc
"rule": "eventType==git.pullrequest.updated&&resource.reviewers.*.displayName=='xianix-agent'"
```

### Azure DevOps example: PR activity via `contains`

Trigger on specific activity messages such as a source branch push or a reviewer being assigned:

```jsonc
// Source branch was updated
"rule": "eventType==git.pullrequest.updated&&resource.reviewers.*.displayName=='xianix-agent'&&message.text*='updated the source branch'"

// Agent was added as a reviewer
"rule": "eventType==git.pullrequest.updated&&resource.reviewers.*.displayName=='xianix-agent'&&message.text*='as a reviewer'"
```

### Example: branch-convention filter with `starts-with`

Only run the workflow for pull requests targeting a `release/` branch:

```jsonc
"rule": "action==opened&&pull_request.base.ref^=release/"
```

### What Happens at Runtime

1. A webhook fires with a name that matches `webhook` (e.g. `"Default"`).
2. For each execution block, if `match-any` is non-empty, at least one `rule` must pass.
3. **Structural fields are resolved first** — `platform`, `repository.url`, `repository.ref`. JSON-path bindings are looked up against the payload; constant bindings (`{ "value": "...", "constant": true }`) are taken verbatim. If a declared *path* doesn't resolve, the block is skipped — constants never fail to resolve.
4. `use-inputs` are resolved from the payload, and the resolved structural values are auto-injected back into the inputs dict under the canonical keys `platform` / `repository-url` / `git-ref`. The short `repository-name` (e.g. `owner/repo`) is **derived** from `repository-url` (platform-aware: handles GitHub, Azure DevOps `_git` URLs, etc.) and injected alongside them so prompts and plugins see a single combined view.
5. `execute-prompt` is interpolated with those inputs (including the auto-injected structural values).
6. The agent resolves `with-envs` (literals, `host.*`, `secrets.*`) and injects them into the executor container alongside the runtime values it manages itself (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.).
7. The executor installs `use-plugins`, `git checkout`s `git-ref` into the per-run worktree (or runs against the bare-clone HEAD when omitted), and runs the final prompt.
